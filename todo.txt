Next on the list:
- load an entire snapshot into the game
- name the snapshot (instead of just a timestamp)
- prompt for save/load arguments if none are provided

Maybe on the list:
- show the current slot info at the end of a command
- watch files and prompt for save if anything changes
-[x] prompt for path to Kura5 exe and data if failed to find either on start up
- make the prompt less scary (disable error dialogue)
-[x] more feedback about currently running version
